CE Geotech continues to play a vital role in the success of construction and infrastructure projects across the UK by providing accurate, reliable geotechnical testing. These services help clients make informed decisions about ground conditions, materials, and long-term performance—ultimately saving time, reducing risk, and improving build quality.

## Key Testing Services and Their Benefits

### 1. **California Bearing Ratio (CBR) Testing**

CBR testing is used to evaluate the strength of subgrade soil and base materials. It’s essential for road construction, car parks, and other paved surfaces.

- **Client Benefit**: Helps engineers determine the appropriate thickness of pavement layers, reducing the risk of premature failure and costly repairs.

### 2. **Moisture Condition Value (MCV)**

MCV testing assesses how easily soil can be compacted and worked with during construction.

- **Client Benefit**: Allows contractors to plan earthworks more efficiently, especially in wet or variable weather conditions, avoiding delays and rework.

### 3. **Sulphate Suite Testing**

This suite of tests identifies the presence of sulphates and pH levels in soil, which can affect concrete durability.

- **Client Benefit**: Ensures that foundations and buried concrete structures are designed to resist chemical attack, protecting long-term structural integrity.

### 4. **Lime Demand Testing**
